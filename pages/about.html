                    Creativity has always accompanied me, since I was a child when I was drawing until today with my
                    profession. In the last few years I have worked hard to develop my skills as a graphic designer. I have
                    done projects, internships, studied at university, worked with clients and worked for 3 years in a
                    company where I was able to contribute
                    significantly to its growth. Thanks to all these experiences that have accompanied me, I have become an
                    organized and disciplined person who believes in working with objective purposes and structured routines
                    always focused on the user.

                    In a world where everything looks similar, for me the fact is to find the core of a brand's essence and that with its identity it can translate its intentions. So that it can embrace the new parameters that arise in the world. Whether it's the way you see it, hear it or interact with it. I'm not just here to make it look pretty, I'm here to make it transcend.

                            With time and experience that I was gaining within the company I was also delegated graphic works. 
                            I was part of the team that made the brand grow significantly in its presence in social networks.</p>

                    I found a variety of jobs that tested my knowledge with different software that I was not used to use but that strengthened and renewed my skills. 
                    I did illustrations, branding and 3D work.</p>

            <p class="p-2 text-left txt-soft">I've been looking for years to reach a result as a designer from which today I'm far away, what keeps this search alive? patience. 
                There are services that are not sold but that are latent when facing a project. I have a personality that can see the indirect result of many design methods and that allows me to build pieces that are different.<br> 
                I have always been a person very connected to the computer and creativity. When I was a kid, I used to entertain myself editing videos for youtube experimenting with software that I didn't know could be working tools in the future. Also before becoming a designer I spent some time doing tattoos, that's why I have skills such as illustration, editing, web development and animation.</p>
